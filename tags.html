        <h3>Hunter 350</h3>
        <pre>
The <strong>Hunter 350</strong> is one good looking motorcycle. It gets an engine that churns out good 
performance but its stiff ride quality makes it little bothersome. In terms of features, the 
Hunter gets the basic ones and misses out the GPS. But its high aspirational value and 
accessible seat height definitely makes it enticing.
